**Baseline Taxonomy:**

**Primary Capability:** First-level taxonomy abstraction element used to categorize and then determine relationships for a Target of Evaluation (ToE)  
**Secondary Capability:** Second-level taxonomy abstraction element used to develop the initial ontology for a ToE  
**Segment:** Third-level taxonomy abstraction element used to develop tertiary ontology for a ToE
**Asset:** Fourth-level taxonomy abstraction element used to develop an operational ontology for a ToE
