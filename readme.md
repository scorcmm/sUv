# Space Universial Visualization (sUv)™ an ethicallyHackingspace(eHs)® Core Community Tool

## Phases
![Framework Phases](Phases.gif)
1. **DECOMPOSE**: Break down the Space Data System using an evolving taxonomy and ontology.
2. **VISUALIZE**: Leverage community icons in a periodic table element, vector icon, or photorealistic format to create a decomposition diagram using draw.io.
3. **ENRICH**: Apply open-source intelligence (OSINT) sources that provide contextual information for the Space Data System.
4. **CATALOG**: Enter the contextual information into an online repository for historical and ongoing research.
5. **ASSESS**: Continually leverage the cataloged information and update enrichment to understand OSINT-based Continuous Threat Exposure management across the space sector.

## DECOMPOSE:

**Primary Capability:** First-level taxonomy abstraction element used to categorize and then determine relationships for a Target of Evaluation (ToE)  

**Secondary Capability:** Second-level taxonomy abstraction element used to develop the initial ontology for a ToE  

**Segment:** Third-level taxonomy abstraction element used to develop a tertiary ontology for a ToE  

**Asset:** Fourth-level taxonomy abstraction element used to develop an operational ontology for a ToE  


## 6 Primary Capability Areas
